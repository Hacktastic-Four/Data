I'm aware of the gradient descent and the back-propagation algorithm. What I don't get is: when is using a bias important and how do you use it?
For example, when mapping the AND function, when I use two inputs and one output, it does not give the correct weights. However, when I use three inputs (one of which is a bias), it gives the correct weights.","
I think that biases are almost always helpful. In effect, a bias value allows you to shift the activation function to the left or right, which may be critical for successful learning.
It might help to look at a simple example. Consider this 1-input, 1-output network that has no bias:
The output of the network is computed by multiplying the input (x) by the weight (w0) and passing the result through some kind of activation function (e.g. a sigmoid function.)
Here is the function that this network computes, for various values of w0:
Changing the weight w0 essentially changes the ""steepness"" of the sigmoid. That's useful, but what if you wanted the network to output 0 when x is 2? Just changing the steepness of the sigmoid won't really work -- you want to be able to shift the entire curve to the right.
That's exactly what the bias allows you to do. If we add a bias to that network, like so:
...then the output of the network becomes sig(w0*x + w1*1.0). Here is what the output of the network looks like for various values of w1:
Having a weight of -5 for w1 shifts the curve to the right, which allows us to have a network that outputs 0 when x is 2."

What is the difference between a generative and a discriminative algorithm?","
Let's say you have input data x and you want to classify the data into labels y. A generative model learns the joint probability distribution p(x,y) and a discriminative model learns the conditional probability distribution p(y|x) - which you should read as ""the probability of y given x"".
Here's a really simple example. Suppose you have the following data in the form (x,y):
(1,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2, 1)
p(x,y) is
      y=0   y=1
     -----------
x=1 | 1/2   0
x=2 | 1/4   1/4
p(y|x) is
      y=0   y=1
     -----------
x=1 | 1     0
x=2 | 1/2   1/2
If you take a few minutes to stare at those two matrices, you will understand the difference between the two probability distributions.
The distribution p(y|x) is the natural distribution for classifying a given example x into a class y, which is why algorithms that model this directly are called discriminative algorithms. Generative algorithms model p(x,y), which can be transformed into p(y|x) by applying Bayes rule and then used for classification. However, the distribution p(x,y) can also be used for other purposes. For example, you could use p(x,y) to generate likely (x,y) pairs.
From the description above, you might be thinking that generative models are more generally useful and therefore better, but it's not as simple as that. This paper is a very popular reference on the subject of discriminative vs. generative classifiers, but it's pretty heavy going. The overall gist is that discriminative models generally outperform generative models in classification tasks."

Your question as I understand it is divided in two parts, part one being you need a better understanding of the Naive Bayes classifier & part two being the confusion surrounding Training set.
In general all of Machine Learning Algorithms need to be trained for supervised learning tasks like classification, prediction etc. or for unsupervised learning tasks like clustering.
During the training step, the algorithms are taught with a particular input dataset (training set) so that later on we may test them for unknown inputs (which they have never seen before) for which they may classify or predict etc (in case of supervised learning) based on their learning. This is what most of the Machine Learning techniques like Neural Networks, SVM, Bayesian etc. are based upon.
So in a general Machine Learning project basically you have to divide your input set to a Development Set (Training Set + Dev-Test Set) & a Test Set (or Evaluation set). Remember your basic objective would be that your system learns and classifies new inputs which they have never seen before in either Dev set or test set.
The test set typically has the same format as the training set. However, it is very important that the test set be distinct from the training corpus: if we simply reused the training set as the test set, then a model that simply memorized its input, without learning how to generalize to new examples, would receive misleadingly high scores.
In general, for an example, 70% of our data can be used as training set cases. Also remember to partition the original set into the training and test sets randomly.
Now I come to your other question about Naive Bayes.
To demonstrate the concept of Naïve Bayes Classification, consider the example given below:
As indicated, the objects can be classified as either GREEN or RED. Our task is to classify new cases as they arrive, i.e., decide to which class label they belong, based on the currently existing objects.
Since there are twice as many GREEN objects as RED, it is reasonable to believe that a new case (which hasn't been observed yet) is twice as likely to have membership GREEN rather than RED. In the Bayesian analysis, this belief is known as the prior probability. Prior probabilities are based on previous experience, in this case the percentage of GREEN and RED objects, and often used to predict outcomes before they actually happen.
Thus, we can write:
Prior Probability of GREEN: number of GREEN objects / total number of objects
Prior Probability of RED: number of RED objects / total number of objects
Since there is a total of 60 objects, 40 of which are GREEN and 20 RED, our prior probabilities for class membership are:
Prior Probability for GREEN: 40 / 60
Prior Probability for RED: 20 / 60
Having formulated our prior probability, we are now ready to classify a new object (WHITE circle in the diagram below). Since the objects are well clustered, it is reasonable to assume that the more GREEN (or RED) objects in the vicinity of X, the more likely that the new cases belong to that particular color. To measure this likelihood, we draw a circle around X which encompasses a number (to be chosen a priori) of points irrespective of their class labels. Then we calculate the number of points in the circle belonging to each class label. From this we calculate the likelihood:
From the illustration above, it is clear that Likelihood of X given GREEN is smaller than Likelihood of X given RED, since the circle encompasses 1 GREEN object and 3 RED ones. Thus:
Although the prior probabilities indicate that X may belong to GREEN (given that there are twice as many GREEN compared to RED) the likelihood indicates otherwise; that the class membership of X is RED (given that there are more RED objects in the vicinity of X than GREEN). In the Bayesian analysis, the final classification is produced by combining both sources of information, i.e., the prior and the likelihood, to form a posterior probability using the so-called Bayes' rule (named after Rev. Thomas Bayes 1702-1761).
Finally, we classify X as RED since its class membership achieves the largest posterior probability."

In the tensorflow API docs they use a keyword called logits. What is it? A lot of methods are written like:
tf.nn.softmax(logits, name=None)
If logits is just a generic Tensor input, why is it named logits?
Secondly, what is the difference between the following two methods?
tf.nn.softmax(logits, name=None)
tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, labels, name=None)
I know what tf.nn.softmax does, but not the other. An example would be really helpful.
tf.nn.softmax(logits, name=None)
tf.nn.softmax(logits, name=None)
tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits, labels, name=None)","
The softmax+logits simply means that the function operates on the unscaled output of earlier layers and that the relative scale to understand the units is linear. It means, in particular, the sum of the inputs may not equal 1, that the values are not probabilities (you might have an input of 5). Internally, it first applies softmax to the unscaled output, and then and then computes the cross entropy of those values vs. what they ""should"" be as defined by the labels.
tf.nn.softmax produces the result of applying the softmax function to an input tensor. The softmax ""squishes"" the inputs so that sum(input) = 1, and it does the mapping by interpreting the inputs as log-probabilities (logits) and then converting them back into raw probabilities between 0 and 1. The shape of output of a softmax is the same as the input:
a = tf.constant(np.array([[.1, .3, .5, .9]]))
print s.run(tf.nn.softmax(a))
[[ 0.16838508  0.205666    0.25120102  0.37474789]]
See this answer for more about why softmax is used extensively in DNNs.
tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits combines the softmax step with the calculation of the cross-entropy loss after applying the softmax function, but it does it all together in a more mathematically careful way. It's similar to the result of:
sm = tf.nn.softmax(x)
ce = cross_entropy(sm)
The cross entropy is a summary metric: it sums across the elements. The output of tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits on a shape [2,5] tensor is of shape [2,1] (the first dimension is treated as the batch).
If you want to do optimization to minimize the cross entropy AND you're softmaxing after your last layer, you should use tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits instead of doing it yourself, because it covers numerically unstable corner cases in the mathematically right way. Otherwise, you'll end up hacking it by adding little epsilons here and there.
Edited 2016-02-07: If you have single-class labels, where an object can only belong to one class, you might now consider using tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits so that you don't have to convert your labels to a dense one-hot array. This function was added after release 0.6.0.
a = tf.constant(np.array([[.1, .3, .5, .9]]))

Here's the explanation directly from the source ( almost )
Search 101!

Worth watching!
Basically and according to Douglas Merrill former CTO of Google it is like this:
1) You write a ( misspelled ) word in google
2) You don't find what you wanted ( don't click on any results )
3) You realize you misspelled the word so you rewrite the word in the search box.
4) You find what you want ( you click in the first links )
This pattern multiplied millions of times, shows what are the most common misspells and what are the most ""common"" corrections.
This way Google can almost instantaneously, offer spell correction in every language.
Also this means if overnight everyone start to spell night as ""nigth"" google would suggest that word instead.
EDIT
@ThomasRutter: Douglas describe it as ""statistical machine learning"".
They know who correct the query, because they know which query comes from which user ( using cookies )
If the users perform a query, and only 10% of the users click on a result and 90% goes back and type another query ( with the corrected word ) and this time that 90% clicks on a result, then they know they have found a correction.
They can also know if those are ""related"" queries of two different, because they have information of all the links they show.
Furthermore, they are now including the context into the spell check, so they can even suggest different word depending on the context.
See this demo of google wave ( @ 44m 06s ) that shows how the context is taken into account to automatically correct the spelling.
Here it is explained how that natural language processing works.
And finally here is an awesome demo of what can be done adding automatic machine translation ( @ 1h 12m 47s ) to the mix.

ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) and SVM (Support Vector Machines) are two popular strategies for supervised machine learning and classification. It's not often clear which method is better for a particular project, and I'm certain the answer is always ""it depends."" Often, a combination of both along with Bayesian classification is used.
These questions on Stackoverflow have already been asked regarding ANN vs SVM:
ANN and SVM classification
what the difference among ANN, SVM and KNN in my classification question
Support Vector Machine or Artificial Neural Network for text processing?
In this question, I'd like to know specifically what aspects of an ANN (specifically, a Multilayer Perceptron) might make it desirable to use over an SVM? The reason I ask is because it's easy to answer the opposite question: Support Vector Machines are often superior to ANNs because they avoid two major weaknesses of ANNs:
(1) ANNs often converge on local minima rather than global minima, meaning that they are essentially ""missing the big picture"" sometimes (or missing the forest for the trees)
(2) ANNs often overfit if training goes on too long, meaning that for any given pattern, an ANN might start to consider the noise as part of the pattern.
SVMs don't suffer from either of these two problems. However, it's not readily apparent that SVMs are meant to be a total replacement for ANNs. So what specific advantage(s) does an ANN have over an SVM that might make it applicable for certain situations? I've listed specific advantages of an SVM over an ANN, now I'd like to see a list of ANN advantages (if any).","
Judging from the examples you provide, I'm assuming that by ANNs, you mean multilayer feed-forward networks (FF nets for short), such as multilayer perceptrons, because those are in direct competition with SVMs.
One specific benefit that these models have over SVMs is that their size is fixed: they are parametric models, while SVMs are non-parametric. That is, in an ANN you have a bunch of hidden layers with sizes h1 through hn depending on the number of features, plus bias parameters, and those make up your model. By contrast, an SVM (at least a kernelized one) consists of a set of support vectors, selected from the training set, with a weight for each. In the worst case, the number of support vectors is exactly the number of training samples (though that mainly occurs with small training sets or in degenerate cases) and in general its model size scales linearly. In natural language processing, SVM classifiers with tens of thousands of support vectors, each having hundreds of thousands of features, is not unheard of.
Also, online training of FF nets is very simple compared to online SVM fitting, and predicting can be quite a bit faster.
EDIT: all of the above pertains to the general case of kernelized SVMs. Linear SVM are a special case in that they are parametric and allow online learning with simple algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent."

They're both correct, but yours is preferred from the point of view of numerical stability.
You start with
e ^ (x - max(x)) / sum(e^(x - max(x))

= e ^ x / (e ^ max(x) * sum(e ^ x / e ^ max(x)))

= e ^ x / sum(e ^ x)
Which is what the other answer says. You could replace max(x) with any variable and it would cancel out.
e ^ (x - max(x)) / sum(e^(x - max(x))

In terms of artificial intelligence and machine learning, what is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? Can you provide a basic, easy explanation with an example?","
Since you ask this very basic question, it looks like it's worth specifying what Machine Learning itself is.
Machine Learning is a class of algorithms which is data-driven, i.e. unlike ""normal"" algorithms it is the data that ""tells"" what the ""good answer"" is. Example: a hypothetical non-machine learning algorithm for face detection in images would try to define what a face is (round skin-like-colored disk, with dark area where you expect the eyes etc). A machine learning algorithm would not have such coded definition, but would ""learn-by-examples"": you'll show several images of faces and not-faces and a good algorithm will eventually learn and be able to predict whether or not an unseen image is a face.
This particular example of face detection is supervised, which means that your examples must be labeled, or explicitly say which ones are faces and which ones aren't.
In an unsupervised algorithm your examples are not labeled, i.e. you don't say anything. Of course, in such a case the algorithm itself cannot ""invent"" what a face is, but it can try to cluster the data into different groups, e.g. it can distinguish that faces are very different from landscapes, which are very different from horses.
Since another answer mentions it (though, in an incorrect way): there are ""intermediate"" forms of supervision, i.e. semi-supervised and active learning. Technically, these are supervised methods in which there is some ""smart"" way to avoid a large number of labeled examples. In active learning, the algorithm itself decides which thing you should label (e.g. it can be pretty sure about a landscape and a horse, but it might ask you to confirm if a gorilla is indeed the picture of a face). In semi-supervised learning, there are two different algorithms which start with the labeled examples, and then ""tell"" each other the way they think about some large number of unlabeled data. From this ""discussion"" they learn."

When we have to predict the value of a categorical (or discrete) outcome we use logistic regression. I believe we use linear regression to also predict the value of an outcome given the input values.
Then, what is the difference between the two methodologies?","
Linear regression output as probabilities
It's tempting to use the linear regression output as probabilities but it's a mistake because the output can be negative, and greater than 1 whereas probability can not. As regression might actually produce probabilities that could be less than 0, or even bigger than 1, logistic regression was introduced.
Source: http://gerardnico.com/wiki/data_mining/simple_logistic_regression
Outcome
In linear regression, the outcome (dependent variable) is continuous. It can have any one of an infinite number of possible values.
In logistic regression, the outcome (dependent variable) has only a limited number of possible values.
The dependent variable
Logistic regression is used when the response variable is categorical in nature. For instance, yes/no, true/false, red/green/blue, 1st/2nd/3rd/4th, etc.
Linear regression is used when your response variable is continuous. For instance, weight, height, number of hours, etc.
Equation
Linear regression gives an equation which is of the form Y = mX + C, means equation with degree 1.
However, logistic regression gives an equation which is of the form Y = eX + e-X
Coefficient interpretation
In linear regression, the coefficient interpretation of independent variables are quite straightforward (i.e. holding all other variables constant, with a unit increase in this variable, the dependent variable is expected to increase/decrease by xxx).
However, in logistic regression, depends on the family (binomial, Poisson, etc.) and link (log, logit, inverse-log, etc.) you use, the interpretation is different.
Error minimization technique
Linear regression uses ordinary least squares method to minimise the errors and arrive at a best possible fit, while logistic regression uses maximum likelihood method to arrive at the solution.
Linear regression is usually solved by minimizing the least squares error of the model to the data, therefore large errors are penalized quadratically.
Logistic regression is just the opposite. Using the logistic loss function causes large errors to be penalized to an asymptotically constant.
Consider linear regression on categorical {0, 1} outcomes to see why this is a problem. If your model predicts the outcome is 38, when the truth is 1, you've lost nothing. Linear regression would try to reduce that 38, logistic wouldn't (as much)2."

When I trained my neural network with Theano or Tensorflow, they will report a variable called ""loss"" per epoch.
How should I interpret this variable? Higher loss is better or worse, or what does it mean for the final performance (accuracy) of my neural network?","
The lower the loss, the better a model (unless the model has over-fitted to the training data). The loss is calculated on training and validation and its interperation is how well the model is doing for these two sets. Unlike accuracy, loss is not a percentage. It is a summation of the errors made for each example in training or validation sets.
In the case of neural networks, the loss is usually negative log-likelihood and residual sum of squares for classification and regression respectively. Then naturally, the main objective in a learning model is to reduce (minimize) the loss function's value with respect to the model's parameters by changing the weight vector values through different optimization methods, such as backpropagation in neural networks.
Loss value implies how well or poorly a certain model behaves after each iteration of optimization. Ideally, one would expect the reduction of loss after each, or several, iteration(s).
The accuracy of a model is usually determined after the model parameters are learned and fixed and no learning is taking place. Then the test samples are fed to the model and the number of mistakes (zero-one loss) the model makes are recorded, after comparison to the true targets. Then the percentage of misclassification is calculated.
For example, if the number of test samples is 1000 and model classifies 952 of those correctly, then the model's accuracy is 95.2%.
There are also some subtleties while reducing the loss value. For instance, you may run into the problem of over-fitting in which the model ""memorizes"" the training examples and becomes kind of ineffective for the test set. Over-fitting also occurs in cases where you do not employ a regularization, you have a very complex model (the number of free parameters W is large) or the number of data points N is very low."

How do I save a trained Naive Bayes classifier to disk and use it to predict data?
I have the following sample program from the scikit-learn website:
from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
gnb = GaussianNB()
y_pred = gnb.fit(iris.data, iris.target).predict(iris.data)
print ""Number of mislabeled points : %d"" % (iris.target != y_pred).sum()
from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
gnb = GaussianNB()
y_pred = gnb.fit(iris.data, iris.target).predict(iris.data)
print ""Number of mislabeled points : %d"" % (iris.target != y_pred).sum()","
Classifiers are just objects that can be pickled and dumped like any other. To continue your example:
import cPickle
# save the classifier
with open('my_dumped_classifier.pkl', 'wb') as fid:
    cPickle.dump(gnb, fid)    

# load it again
with open('my_dumped_classifier.pkl', 'rb') as fid:
    gnb_loaded = cPickle.load(fid)
Edit: if you are using a sklearn Pipeline in which you have custom transformers that cannot be serialized by pickle (nor by joblib), then using Neuraxle's custom ML Pipeline saving is a solution where you can define your own custom step savers on a per-step basis. The savers are called for each step if defined upon saving, and otherwise joblib is used as default for steps without a saver.
import cPickle
# save the classifier
with open('my_dumped_classifier.pkl', 'wb') as fid:
    cPickle.dump(gnb, fid)    

# load it again
with open('my_dumped_classifier.pkl', 'rb') as fid:
    gnb_loaded = cPickle.load(fid)"

Is there a rule-of-thumb for how to best divide data into training and validation sets? Is an even 50/50 split advisable? Or are there clear advantages of having more training data relative to validation data (or vice versa)? Or is this choice pretty much application dependent?
I have been mostly using an 80% / 20% of training and validation data, respectively, but I chose this division without any principled reason. Can someone who is more experienced in machine learning advise me?","
There are two competing concerns: with less training data, your parameter estimates have greater variance. With less testing data, your performance statistic will have greater variance. Broadly speaking you should be concerned with dividing data such that neither variance is too high, which is more to do with the absolute number of instances in each category rather than the percentage.
If you have a total of 100 instances, you're probably stuck with cross validation as no single split is going to give you satisfactory variance in your estimates. If you have 100,000 instances, it doesn't really matter whether you choose an 80:20 split or a 90:10 split (indeed you may choose to use less training data if your method is particularly computationally intensive).
Assuming you have enough data to do proper held-out test data (rather than cross-validation), the following is an instructive way to get a handle on variances:
Split your data into training and testing (80/20 is indeed a good starting point)
Split the training data into training and validation (again, 80/20 is a fair split).
Subsample random selections of your training data, train the classifier with this, and record the performance on the validation set
Try a series of runs with different amounts of training data: randomly sample 20% of it, say, 10 times and observe performance on the validation data, then do the same with 40%, 60%, 80%. You should see both greater performance with more data, but also lower variance across the different random samples
To get a handle on variance due to the size of test data, perform the same procedure in reverse. Train on all of your training data, then randomly sample a percentage of your validation data a number of times, and observe performance. You should now find that the mean performance on small samples of your validation data is roughly the same as the performance on all the validation data, but the variance is much higher with smaller numbers of test samples"

How do I initialize weights and biases of a network (via e.g. He or Xavier initialization)?","
Single layer
To initialize the weights of a single layer, use a function from torch.nn.init. For instance:
conv1 = torch.nn.Conv2d(...)
torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform(conv1.weight)
Alternatively, you can modify the parameters by writing to conv1.weight.data (which is a torch.Tensor). Example:
conv1.weight.data.fill_(0.01)
The same applies for biases:
conv1.bias.data.fill_(0.01)
nn.Sequential or custom nn.Module
Pass an initialization function to torch.nn.Module.apply. It will initialize the weights in the entire nn.Module recursively.
apply(fn): Applies fn recursively to every submodule (as returned by .children()) as well as self. Typical use includes initializing the parameters of a model (see also torch-nn-init).
Example:
def init_weights(m):
    if isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
        torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform(m.weight)
        m.bias.data.fill_(0.01)

net = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(2, 2), nn.Linear(2, 2))
net.apply(init_weights)
conv1 = torch.nn.Conv2d(...)
torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform(conv1.weight)
conv1.weight.data.fill_(0.01)
conv1.bias.data.fill_(0.01)
def init_weights(m):
    if isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
        torch.nn.init.xavier_uniform(m.weight)
        m.bias.data.fill_(0.01)

net = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(2, 2), nn.Linear(2, 2))

Suppose I'm working on some classification problem. (Fraud detection and comment spam are two problems I'm working on right now, but I'm curious about any classification task in general.)
How do I know which classifier I should use?
Decision tree
SVM
Bayesian
Neural network
K-nearest neighbors
Q-learning
Genetic algorithm
Markov decision processes
Convolutional neural networks
Linear regression or logistic regression
Boosting, bagging, ensambling
Random hill climbing or simulated annealing
...
In which cases is one of these the ""natural"" first choice, and what are the principles for choosing that one?
Examples of the type of answers I'm looking for (from Manning et al.'s Introduction to Information Retrieval book):
a. If your data is labeled, but you only have a limited amount, you should use a classifier with high bias (for example, Naive Bayes).
I'm guessing this is because a higher-bias classifier will have lower variance, which is good because of the small amount of data.
b. If you have a ton of data, then the classifier doesn't really matter so much, so you should probably just choose a classifier with good scalability.
What are other guidelines? Even answers like ""if you'll have to explain your model to some upper management person, then maybe you should use a decision tree, since the decision rules are fairly transparent"" are good. I care less about implementation/library issues, though.
Also, for a somewhat separate question, besides standard Bayesian classifiers, are there 'standard state-of-the-art' methods for comment spam detection (as opposed to email spam)?",

The reason for this apparent performance discrepancy between categorical & binary cross entropy is what user xtof54 has already reported in his answer below, i.e.:
the accuracy computed with the Keras method evaluate is just plain wrong when using binary_crossentropy with more than 2 labels
I would like to elaborate more on this, demonstrate the actual underlying issue, explain it, and offer a remedy.
This behavior is not a bug; the underlying reason is a rather subtle & undocumented issue at how Keras actually guesses which accuracy to use, depending on the loss function you have selected, when you include simply metrics=['accuracy'] in your model compilation. In other words, while your first compilation option
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
is valid, your second one:
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
will not produce what you expect, but the reason is not the use of binary cross entropy (which, at least in principle, is an absolutely valid loss function).
Why is that? If you check the metrics source code, Keras does not define a single accuracy metric, but several different ones, among them binary_accuracy and categorical_accuracy. What happens under the hood is that, since you have selected binary cross entropy as your loss function and have not specified a particular accuracy metric, Keras (wrongly...) infers that you are interested in the binary_accuracy, and this is what it returns - while in fact you are interested in the categorical_accuracy.
Let's verify that this is the case, using the MNIST CNN example in Keras, with the following modification:
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])  # WRONG way

model.fit(x_train, y_train,
          batch_size=batch_size,
          epochs=2,  # only 2 epochs, for demonstration purposes
          verbose=1,
          validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

# Keras reported accuracy:
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0) 
score[1]
# 0.9975801164627075

# Actual accuracy calculated manually:
import numpy as np
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
acc = sum([np.argmax(y_test[i])==np.argmax(y_pred[i]) for i in range(10000)])/10000
acc
# 0.98780000000000001

score[1]==acc
# False    
To remedy this, i.e. to use indeed binary cross entropy as your loss function (as I said, nothing wrong with this, at least in principle) while still getting the categorical accuracy required by the problem at hand, you should ask explicitly for categorical_accuracy in the model compilation as follows:
from keras.metrics import categorical_accuracy
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=[categorical_accuracy])
In the MNIST example, after training, scoring, and predicting the test set as I show above, the two metrics now are the same, as they should be:
# Keras reported accuracy:
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0) 
score[1]
# 0.98580000000000001

# Actual accuracy calculated manually:
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
acc = sum([np.argmax(y_test[i])==np.argmax(y_pred[i]) for i in range(10000)])/10000

Here are some stumbling blocks that I see in other answers:
Using tree_.threshold == -2 to decide whether a node is a leaf isn't a good idea. What if it's a real decision node with a threshold of -2? Instead, you should look at tree.feature or tree.children_*.
The line features = [feature_names[i] for i in tree_.feature] crashes with my version of sklearn, because some values of tree.tree_.feature are -2 (specifically for leaf nodes).
There is no need to have multiple if statements in the recursive function, just one is fine.

I've been reading some things on neural networks and I understand the general principle of a single layer neural network. I understand the need for aditional layers, but why are nonlinear activation functions used?
This question is followed by this one: What is a derivative of the activation function used for in backpropagation?","
The purpose of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the network
in turn, this allows you to model a response variable (aka target variable, class label, or score) that varies non-linearly with its explanatory variables
non-linear means that the output cannot be reproduced from a linear combination of the inputs (which is not the same as output that renders to a straight line--the word for this is affine).
another way to think of it: without a non-linear activation function in the network, a NN, no matter how many layers it had, would behave just like a single-layer perceptron, because summing these layers would give you just another linear function (see definition just above).

I am trying to understand the role of the Flatten function in Keras. Below is my code, which is a simple two-layer network. It takes in 2-dimensional data of shape (3, 2), and outputs 1-dimensional data of shape (1, 4):
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(16, input_shape=(3, 2)))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(4))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='SGD')

x = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]])

y = model.predict(x)

print y.shape
This prints out that y has shape (1, 4). However, if I remove the Flatten line, then it prints out that y has shape (1, 3, 4).
I don't understand this. From my understanding of neural networks, the model.add(Dense(16, input_shape=(3, 2))) function is creating a hidden fully-connected layer, with 16 nodes. Each of these nodes is connected to each of the 3x2 input elements. Therefore, the 16 nodes at the output of this first layer are already ""flat"". So, the output shape of the first layer should be (1, 16). Then, the second layer takes this as an input, and outputs data of shape (1, 4).
So if the output of the first layer is already ""flat"" and of shape (1, 16), why do I need to further flatten it?
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(16, input_shape=(3, 2)))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(4))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='SGD')

x = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]])

y = model.predict(x)

print y.shape","
If you read the Keras documentation entry for Dense, you will see that this call:
Dense(16, input_shape=(5,3))
would result in a Dense network with 3 inputs and 16 outputs which would be applied independently for each of 5 steps. So, if D(x) transforms 3 dimensional vector to 16-d vector, what you'll get as output from your layer would be a sequence of vectors: [D(x[0,:]), D(x[1,:]),..., D(x[4,:])] with shape (5, 16). In order to have the behavior you specify you may first Flatten your input to a 15-d vector and then apply Dense:
model = Sequential()
model.add(Flatten(input_shape=(3, 2)))
model.add(Dense(16))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dense(4))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='SGD')
EDIT: As some people struggled to understand - here you have an explaining image:
Dense(16, input_shape=(5,3))
model = Sequential()
model.add(Flatten(input_shape=(3, 2)))

Why do we have to normalize the input for a neural network?
I understand that sometimes, when for example the input values are non-numerical a certain transformation must be performed, but when we have a numerical input? Why the numbers must be in a certain interval?
What will happen if the data is not normalized?","
It's explained well here.
If the input variables are combined linearly, as in an MLP [multilayer perceptron], then it is rarely strictly necessary to standardize the inputs, at least in theory. The reason is that any rescaling of an input vector can be effectively undone by changing the corresponding weights and biases, leaving you with the exact same outputs as you had before. However, there are a variety of practical reasons why standardizing the inputs can make training faster and reduce the chances of getting stuck in local optima. Also, weight decay and Bayesian estimation can be done more conveniently with standardized inputs."

I have asked a question a few days back on how to find the nearest neighbors for a given vector. My vector is now 21 dimensions and before I proceed further, because I am not from the domain of Machine Learning nor Math, I am beginning to ask myself some fundamental questions:
Is Euclidean distance a good metric for finding the nearest neighbors in the first place? If not, what are my options?
In addition, how does one go about deciding the right threshold for determining the k-neighbors? Is there some analysis that can be done to figure this value out?
Previously, I was suggested to use kd-Trees but the Wikipedia page clearly says that for high-dimensions, kd-Tree is almost equivalent to a brute-force search. In that case, what is the best way to find nearest-neighbors in a million point dataset efficiently?
Can someone please clarify the some (or all) of the above questions?","
I currently study such problems -- classification, nearest neighbor searching -- for music information retrieval.
You may be interested in Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms. The idea is that you allow the algorithm to return sufficiently near neighbors (perhaps not the nearest neighbor); in doing so, you reduce complexity. You mentioned the kd-tree; that is one example. But as you said, kd-tree works poorly in high dimensions. In fact, all current indexing techniques (based on space partitioning) degrade to linear search for sufficiently high dimensions [1][2][3].
Among ANN algorithms proposed recently, perhaps the most popular is Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which maps a set of points in a high-dimensional space into a set of bins, i.e., a hash table [1][3]. But unlike traditional hashes, a locality-sensitive hash places nearby points into the same bin.
LSH has some huge advantages. First, it is simple. You just compute the hash for all points in your database, then make a hash table from them. To query, just compute the hash of the query point, then retrieve all points in the same bin from the hash table.
Second, there is a rigorous theory that supports its performance. It can be shown that the query time is sublinear in the size of the database, i.e., faster than linear search. How much faster depends upon how much approximation we can tolerate.
Finally, LSH is compatible with any Lp norm for 0 < p <= 2. Therefore, to answer your first question, you can use LSH with the Euclidean distance metric, or you can use it with the Manhattan (L1) distance metric. There are also variants for Hamming distance and cosine similarity.
A decent overview was written by Malcolm Slaney and Michael Casey for IEEE Signal Processing Magazine in 2008 [4].
LSH has been applied seemingly everywhere. You may want to give it a try.

I recently started studying deep learning and other ML techniques, and I started searching for frameworks that simplify the process of build a net and training it, then I found TensorFlow, having little experience in the field, for me, it seems that speed is a big factor for making a big ML system even more if working with deep learning, so why python was chosen by Google to make TensorFlow? Wouldn't it be better to make it over an language that can be compiled and not interpreted?
What are the advantages of using Python over a language like C++ for machine learning?","
The most important thing to realize about TensorFlow is that, for the most part, the core is not written in Python: It's written in a combination of highly-optimized C++ and CUDA (Nvidia's language for programming GPUs). Much of that happens, in turn, by using Eigen (a high-performance C++ and CUDA numerical library) and NVidia's cuDNN (a very optimized DNN library for NVidia GPUs, for functions such as convolutions).
The model for TensorFlow is that the programmer uses ""some language"" (most likely Python!) to express the model. This model, written in the TensorFlow constructs such as:
h1 = tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(l1, W1) + b1)
h2 = ...
is not actually executed when the Python is run. Instead, what's actually created is a dataflow graph that says to take particular inputs, apply particular operations, supply the results as the inputs to other operations, and so on. This model is executed by fast C++ code, and for the most part, the data going between operations is never copied back to the Python code.
Then the programmer ""drives"" the execution of this model by pulling on nodes -- for training, usually in Python, and for serving, sometimes in Python and sometimes in raw C++:
sess.run(eval_results)
This one Python (or C++ function call) uses either an in-process call to C++ or an RPC for the distributed version to call into the C++ TensorFlow server to tell it to execute, and then copies back the results.
So, with that said, let's re-phrase the question: Why did TensorFlow choose Python as the first well-supported language for expressing and controlling the training of models?
The answer to that is simple: Python is probably the most comfortable language for a large range of data scientists and machine learning experts that's also that easy to integrate and have control a C++ backend, while also being general, widely-used both inside and outside of Google, and open source. Given that with the basic model of TensorFlow, the performance of Python isn't that important, it was a natural fit. It's also a huge plus that NumPy makes it easy to do pre-processing in Python -- also with high performance -- before feeding it in to TensorFlow for the truly CPU-heavy things.
There's also a bunch of complexity in expressing the model that isn't used when executing it -- shape inference (e.g., if you do matmul(A, B), what is the shape of the resulting data?) and automatic gradient computation. It turns out to have been nice to be able to express those in Python, though I think in the long term they'll probably move to the C++ backend to make adding other languages easier.
(The hope, of course, is to support other languages in the future for creating and expressing models. It's already quite straightforward to run inference using several other languages -- C++ works now, someone from Facebook contributed Go bindings that we're reviewing now, etc.)

The idea behind StandardScaler is that it will transform your data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1.
In case of multivariate data, this is done feature-wise (in other words independently for each column of the data).
Given the distribution of the data, each value in the dataset will have the mean value subtracted, and then divided by the standard deviation of the whole dataset (or feature in the multivariate case)."

I noticed that LSH seems a good way to find similar items with high-dimension properties.
After reading the paper http://www.slaney.org/malcolm/yahoo/Slaney2008-LSHTutorial.pdf, I'm still confused with those formulas.
Does anyone know a blog or article that explains that the easy way?","
The best tutorial I have seen for LSH is in the book: Mining of Massive Datasets. Check Chapter 3 - Finding Similar Items http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch3a.pdf
Also I recommend the below slide: http://www.cs.jhu.edu/%7Evandurme/papers/VanDurmeLallACL10-slides.pdf . The example in the slide helps me a lot in understanding the hashing for cosine similarity.
I borrow two slides from Benjamin Van Durme & Ashwin Lall, ACL2010 and try to explain the intuitions of LSH Families for Cosine Distance a bit.
In the figure, there are two circles w/ red and yellow colored, representing two two-dimensional data points. We are trying to find their cosine similarity using LSH.
The gray lines are some uniformly randomly picked planes.
Depending on whether the data point locates above or below a gray line, we mark this relation as 0/1.
On the upper-left corner, there are two rows of white/black squares, representing the signature of the two data points respectively. Each square is corresponding to a bit 0(white) or 1(black).
So once you have a pool of planes, you can encode the data points with their location respective to the planes. Imagine that when we have more planes in the pool, the angular difference encoded in the signature is closer to the actual difference. Because only planes that resides between the two points will give the two data different bit value.
Now we look at the signature of the two data points. As in the example, we use only 6 bits(squares) to represent each data. This is the LSH hash for the original data we have.
The hamming distance between the two hashed value is 1, because their signatures only differ by 1 bit.
Considering the length of the signature, we can calculate their angular similarity as shown in the graph.
I have some sample code (just 50 lines) in python here which is using cosine similarity. https://gist.github.com/94a3d425009be0f94751"

Image source: Andrej Karpathy
Now I wonder how a minimalistic code snippet for each of them would look like in Keras. So something like
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(timesteps, data_dim)))
model.add(Dense(1))
for each of the 4 tasks, maybe with a little bit of explanation.
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(timesteps, data_dim)))
model.add(Dense(1))","
So:
One-to-one: you could use a Dense layer as you are not processing sequences:
model.add(Dense(output_size, input_shape=input_shape))
One-to-many: this option is not supported well as chaining models is not very easy in Keras, so the following version is the easiest one:
model.add(RepeatVector(number_of_times, input_shape=input_shape))
model.add(LSTM(output_size, return_sequences=True))
Many-to-one: actually, your code snippet is (almost) an example of this approach:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(1, input_shape=(timesteps, data_dim)))
Many-to-many: This is the easiest snippet when the length of the input and output matches the number of recurrent steps:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(1, input_shape=(timesteps, data_dim), return_sequences=True))
Many-to-many when number of steps differ from input/output length: this is freaky hard in Keras. There are no easy code snippets to code that.
EDIT: Ad 5
In one of my recent applications, we implemented something which might be similar to many-to-many from the 4th image. In case you want to have a network with the following architecture (when an input is longer than the output):
                                        O O O
                                        | | |

                                  | | | | | | 
                                  O O O O O O
You could achieve this in the following manner:
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(1, input_shape=(timesteps, data_dim), return_sequences=True))
model.add(Lambda(lambda x: x[:, -N:, :])) #Select last N from output
Where N is the number of last steps you want to cover (on image N = 3).
From this point getting to:
                                        O O O
                                        | | |
                                  O O O O O O
                                  | | | 
                                  O O O 
is as simple as artificial padding sequence of length N using e.g. with 0 vectors, in order to adjust it to an appropriate size.

Where is an explicit connection between the optimizer and the loss?
How does the optimizer know where to get the gradients of the loss without a call liks this optimizer.step(loss)?
-More context-
When I minimize the loss, I didn't have to pass the gradients to the optimizer.
loss.backward() # Back Propagation
optimizer.step() # Gardient Descent","
Without delving too deep into the internals of pytorch, I can offer a simplistic answer:
Recall that when initializing optimizer you explicitly tell it what parameters (tensors) of the model it should be updating. The gradients are ""stored"" by the tensors themselves (they have a grad and a requires_grad attributes) once you call backward() on the loss. After computing the gradients for all tensors in the model, calling optimizer.step() makes the optimizer iterate over all parameters (tensors) it is supposed to update and use their internally stored grad to update their values.
More info on computational graphs and the additional ""grad"" information stored in pytorch tensors can be found in this answer.
Referencing the parameters by the optimizer can sometimes cause troubles, e.g., when the model is moved to GPU after initializing the optimizer. Make sure you are done setting up your model before constructing the optimizer. See this answer for more details."

You get this error because your model is on the GPU, but your data is on the CPU. So, you need to send your input tensors to the GPU.
inputs, labels = data                         # this is what you had

The same error will be raised if your input tensors are on the GPU but your model weights aren't. In this case, you need to send your model weights to the GPU.

37,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33091376/what-is-exactly-sklearn-pipeline-pipeline,What is exactly sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline?,"
I can't figure out how the sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline works exactly.
There are a few explanation in the doc. For example what do they mean by:
Pipeline of transforms with a final estimator.
To make my question clearer, what are steps? How do they work?
Edit
Thanks to the answers I can make my question clearer:
When I call pipeline and pass, as steps, two transformers and one estimator, e.g:
pipln = Pipeline([(""trsfm1"",transformer_1),
                  (""trsfm2"",transformer_2),
                  (""estmtr"",estimator)])
What happens when I call this?
pipln.fit()
OR
pipln.fit_transform()
I can't figure out how an estimator can be a transformer and how a transformer can be fitted.
pipln = Pipeline([(""trsfm1"",transformer_1),
                  (""trsfm2"",transformer_2),
                  (""estmtr"",estimator)])
pipln.fit()
OR
pipln.fit_transform()","
Transformer in scikit-learn - some class that have fit and transform method, or fit_transform method.
Predictor - some class that has fit and predict methods, or fit_predict method.
Pipeline is just an abstract notion, it's not some existing ml algorithm. Often in ML tasks you need to perform sequence of different transformations (find set of features, generate new features, select only some good features) of raw dataset before applying final estimator.
Here is a good example of Pipeline usage. Pipeline gives you a single interface for all 3 steps of transformation and resulting estimator. It encapsulates transformers and predictors inside, and now you can do something like:
    vect = CountVectorizer()
    tfidf = TfidfTransformer()
    clf = SGDClassifier()

    vX = vect.fit_transform(Xtrain)
    tfidfX = tfidf.fit_transform(vX)
    predicted = clf.fit_predict(tfidfX)

    # Now evaluate all steps on test set
    vX = vect.fit_transform(Xtest)
    tfidfX = tfidf.fit_transform(vX)
    predicted = clf.fit_predict(tfidfX)
With just:
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('vect', CountVectorizer()),
    ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
    ('clf', SGDClassifier()),
])
predicted = pipeline.fit(Xtrain).predict(Xtrain)
# Now evaluate all steps on test set
predicted = pipeline.predict(Xtest)
With pipelines you can easily perform a grid-search over set of parameters for each step of this meta-estimator. As described in the link above. All steps except last one must be transforms, last step can be transformer or predictor. Answer to edit: When you call pipln.fit() - each transformer inside pipeline will be fitted on outputs of previous transformer (First transformer is learned on raw dataset). Last estimator may be transformer or predictor, you can call fit_transform() on pipeline only if your last estimator is transformer (that implements fit_transform, or transform and fit methods separately), you can call fit_predict() or predict() on pipeline only if your last estimator is predictor. So you just can't call fit_transform or transform on pipeline, last step of which is predictor.
    vect = CountVectorizer()
    tfidf = TfidfTransformer()
    clf = SGDClassifier()

    vX = vect.fit_transform(Xtrain)
    tfidfX = tfidf.fit_transform(vX)
    predicted = clf.fit_predict(tfidfX)

    # Now evaluate all steps on test set
    vX = vect.fit_transform(Xtest)
    tfidfX = tfidf.fit_transform(vX)
    predicted = clf.fit_predict(tfidfX)
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('vect', CountVectorizer()),
    ('tfidf', TfidfTransformer()),
    ('clf', SGDClassifier()),
])
predicted = pipeline.fit(Xtrain).predict(Xtrain)

I'm currently trying to get an ANN to play a video game and and I was hoping to get some help from the wonderful community here.
I've settled on Diablo 2. Game play is thus in real-time and from an isometric viewpoint, with the player controlling a single avatar whom the camera is centered on.
To make things concrete, the task is to get your character x experience points without having its health drop to 0, where experience point are gained through killing monsters. Here is an example of the gameplay:
Now, since I want the net to operate based solely on the information it gets from the pixels on the screen, it must learn a very rich representation in order to play efficiently, since this would presumably require it to know (implicitly at least) how divide the game world up into objects and how to interact with them.
And all of this information must be taught to the net somehow. I can't for the life of me think of how to train this thing. My only idea is have a separate program visually extract something innately good/bad in the game (e.g. health, gold, experience) from the screen, and then use that stat in a reinforcement learning procedure. I think that will be part of the answer, but I don't think it'll be enough; there are just too many levels of abstraction from raw visual input to goal-oriented behavior for such limited feedback to train a net within my lifetime.
So, my question: what other ways can you think of to train a net to do at least some part of this task? preferably without making thousands of labeled examples.
Just for a little more direction: I'm looking for some other sources of reinforcement learning and/or any unsupervised methods for extracting useful information in this setting. Or a supervised algorithm if you can think of a way of getting labeled data out of a game world without having to manually label it.
UPDATE(04/27/12):
Strangely, I'm still working on this and seem to be making progress. The biggest secret to getting a ANN controller to work is to use the most advanced ANN architectures appropriate to the task. Hence I've been using a deep belief net composed of factored conditional restricted Boltzmann machines that I've trained in an unsupervised manner (on video of me playing the game) before fine tuning with temporal difference back-propagation (i.e. reinforcement learning with standard feed-forward ANNs).
Still looking for more valuable input though, especially on the problem of action selection in real-time and how to encode color images for ANN processing :-)
UPDATE(10/21/15):
Just remembered I asked this question back-in-the-day, and thought I should mention that this is no longer a crazy idea. Since my last update, DeepMind published their nature paper on getting neural networks to play Atari games from visual inputs. Indeed, the only thing preventing me from using their architecture to play, a limited subset, of Diablo 2 is the lack of access to the underlying game engine. Rendering to the screen and then redirecting it to the network is just far too slow to train in a reasonable amount of time. Thus we probably won't see this sort of bot playing Diablo 2 anytime soon, but only because it'll be playing something either open-source or with API access to the rendering target. (Quake perhaps?)","
I can see that you are worried about how to train the ANN, but this project hides a complexity that you might not be aware of. Object/character recognition on computer games through image processing it's a highly challenging task (not say crazy for FPS and RPG games). I don't doubt of your skills and I'm also not saying it can't be done, but you can easily spend 10x more time working on recognizing stuff than implementing the ANN itself (assuming you already have experience with digital image processing techniques).
I think your idea is very interesting and also very ambitious. At this point you might want to reconsider it. I sense that this project is something you are planning for the university, so if the focus of the work is really ANN you should probably pick another game, something more simple.
I remember that someone else came looking for tips on a different but somehow similar project not too long ago. It's worth checking it out.
On the other hand, there might be better/easier approaches for identifying objects in-game if you're accepting suggestions. But first, let's call this project for what you want it to be: a smart-bot.
One method for implementing bots accesses the memory of the game client to find relevant information, such as the location of the character on the screen and it's health. Reading computer memory is trivial, but figuring out exactly where in memory to look for is not. Memory scanners like Cheat Engine can be very helpful for this.
Another method, which works under the game, involves manipulating rendering information. All objects of the game must be rendered to the screen. This means that the locations of all 3D objects will eventually be sent to the video card for processing. Be ready for some serious debugging.
In this answer I briefly described 2 methods to accomplish what you want through image processing. If you are interested in them you can find more about them on Exploiting Online Games (chapter 6), an excellent book on the subject."

There are lots of things I have seen make a model diverge.
Too high of a learning rate. You can often tell if this is the case if the loss begins to increase and then diverges to infinity.
I am not to familiar with the DNNClassifier but I am guessing it uses the categorical cross entropy cost function. This involves taking the log of the prediction which diverges as the prediction approaches zero. That is why people usually add a small epsilon value to the prediction to prevent this divergence. I am guessing the DNNClassifier probably does this or uses the tensorflow opp for it. Probably not the issue.
Other numerical stability issues can exist such as division by zero where adding the epsilon can help. Another less obvious one if the square root whose derivative can diverge if not properly simplified when dealing with finite precision numbers. Yet again I doubt this is the issue in the case of the DNNClassifier.
You may have an issue with the input data. Try calling assert not np.any(np.isnan(x)) on the input data to make sure you are not introducing the nan. Also make sure all of the target values are valid. Finally, make sure the data is properly normalized. You probably want to have the pixels in the range [-1, 1] and not [0, 255].
The labels must be in the domain of the loss function, so if using a logarithmic-based loss function all labels must be non-negative (as noted by evan pu and the comments below)."

Is there a rule of thumb (or set of examples) to determine when to use genetic algorithms as opposed to neural networks (and vice-versa) to solve a problem?
I know there are cases in which you can have both methods mixed, but I am looking for a high-level comparison between the two methods.","
From wikipedia:
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search technique used in computing to find exact or approximate solutions to optimization and search problems.
and:
Neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data.
If you have a problem where you can quantify the worth of a solution, a genetic algorithm can perform a directed search of the solution space. (E.g. find the shortest route between two points)
When you have a number of items in different classes, a neural network can ""learn"" to classify items it has not ""seen"" before. (E.g. face recognition, voice recognition)
Execution times must also be considered. A genetic algorithm takes a long time to find an acceptable solution. A neural network takes a long time to ""learn"", but then it can almost instantly classify new inputs."

I think there is a lot of confusion about which weights are used for what. I am not sure I know precisely what bothers you so I am going to cover different topics, bear with me ;).
Class weights
The weights from the class_weight parameter are used to train the classifier. They are not used in the calculation of any of the metrics you are using: with different class weights, the numbers will be different simply because the classifier is different.
Basically in every scikit-learn classifier, the class weights are used to tell your model how important a class is. That means that during the training, the classifier will make extra efforts to classify properly the classes with high weights.
How they do that is algorithm-specific. If you want details about how it works for SVC and the doc does not make sense to you, feel free to mention it.
The metrics
Once you have a classifier, you want to know how well it is performing. Here you can use the metrics you mentioned: accuracy, recall_score, f1_score...
Usually when the class distribution is unbalanced, accuracy is considered a poor choice as it gives high scores to models which just predict the most frequent class.
I will not detail all these metrics but note that, with the exception of accuracy, they are naturally applied at the class level: as you can see in this print of a classification report they are defined for each class. They rely on concepts such as true positives or false negative that require defining which class is the positive one.

You get this warning because you are using the f1-score, recall and precision without defining how they should be computed! The question could be rephrased: from the above classification report, how do you output one global number for the f1-score? You could:
Take the average of the f1-score for each class: that's the avg / total result above. It's also called macro averaging.
Compute the f1-score using the global count of true positives / false negatives, etc. (you sum the number of true positives / false negatives for each class). Aka micro averaging.
Compute a weighted average of the f1-score. Using 'weighted' in scikit-learn will weigh the f1-score by the support of the class: the more elements a class has, the more important the f1-score for this class in the computation.
These are 3 of the options in scikit-learn, the warning is there to say you have to pick one. So you have to specify an average argument for the score method.
Which one you choose is up to how you want to measure the performance of the classifier: for instance macro-averaging does not take class imbalance into account and the f1-score of class 1 will be just as important as the f1-score of class 5. If you use weighted averaging however you'll get more importance for the class 5.
The whole argument specification in these metrics is not super-clear in scikit-learn right now, it will get better in version 0.18 according to the docs. They are removing some non-obvious standard behavior and they are issuing warnings so that developers notice it.
Computing scores
Last thing I want to mention (feel free to skip it if you're aware of it) is that scores are only meaningful if they are computed on data that the classifier has never seen. This is extremely important as any score you get on data that was used in fitting the classifier is completely irrelevant.
Here's a way to do it using StratifiedShuffleSplit, which gives you a random splits of your data (after shuffling) that preserve the label distribution.

I'm learning different methods to convert categorical variables to numeric for machine-learning classifiers. I came across the pd.get_dummies method and sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder() and I wanted to see how they differed in terms of performance and usage.
I found a tutorial on how to use OneHotEncoder() on https://xgdgsc.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/note-on-using-onehotencoder-in-scikit-learn-to-work-on-categorical-features/ since the sklearn documentation wasn't too helpful on this feature. I have a feeling I'm not doing it correctly...but
Can some explain the pros and cons of using pd.dummies over sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder() and vice versa? I know that OneHotEncoder() gives you a sparse matrix but other than that I'm not sure how it is used and what the benefits are over the pandas method. Am I using it inefficiently?

OneHotEncoder cannot process string values directly. If your nominal features are strings, then you need to first map them into integers.
pandas.get_dummies is kind of the opposite. By default, it only converts string columns into one-hot representation, unless columns are specified."

In reinforcement learning, what is the difference between policy iteration and value iteration?
As much as I understand, in value iteration, you use the Bellman equation to solve for the optimal policy, whereas, in policy iteration, you randomly select a policy π, and find the reward of that policy.
My doubt is that if you are selecting a random policy π in PI, how is it guaranteed to be the optimal policy, even if we are choosing several random policies.",

When we calculate the F-Measure considering both Precision and Recall, we take the harmonic mean of the two measures instead of a simple arithmetic mean.
What is the intuitive reason behind taking the harmonic mean and not a simple average?","
Here we already have some elaborate answers, but I thought some more information about it would be helpful for some guys who want to delve deeper(especially why F measure).
According to the theory of measurement, the composite measure should satisfy the following 6 definitions:
Connectedness(two pairs can be ordered) and transitivity(if e1 >= e2 and e2 >= e3 then e1 >= e3)
Independence: two components contribute their effects independently to the effectiveness.
Thomsen condition: Given that at a constant recall (precision) we find a difference in effectiveness for two values of precision (recall), then this difference cannot be removed or reversed by changing the constant value.
Restricted solvability.
Each component is essential: Variation in one while leaving the other constant gives a variation in effectiveness.
Archimedean property for each component. It merely ensures that the intervals on a component are comparable.
We can then derive and get the function of the effectiveness:
And normally we don't use the effectiveness but the much simpler F score
because F is just 1 - E:
Now that we take the general formula of F measure:
where we can place more emphasis on recall or precision by setting beta, because beta is defined as follows:
If we recall weight more important than precision(all relevant are selected), we can set beta as 2 and we get the F2 measure. And if we do the reverse and weight precision higher than recall(as many selected elements are relevant as possible, for instance in some grammar error correction scenarios like CoNLL) we just set beta as 0.5 and get the F0.5 measure. And obviously, we can set beta as 1 to get the most used F1 measure(harmonic mean of precision and recall).
I think to some extent I have already answered why we do not use the arithmetic meaning.

In the iOS email client, when an email contains a date, time or location, the text becomes a hyperlink and it is possible to create an appointment or look at a map simply by tapping the link. It not only works for emails in English, but in other languages also. I love this feature and would like to understand how they do it.
The naive way to do this would be to have many regular expressions and run them all. However I this is not going to scale very well and will work for only a specific language or date format, etc. I think that Apple must be using some concept of machine learning to extract entities (8:00PM, 8PM, 8:00, 0800, 20:00, 20h, 20h00, 2000 etc.).
Any idea how Apple is able to extract entities so quickly in its email client? What machine learning algorithm would you to apply accomplish such task?","
They likely use Information Extraction techniques for this.
Here is a demo of Stanford's SUTime tool:
http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sutime/process
You would extract attributes about n-grams (consecutive words) in a document:
numberOfLetters
numberOfSymbols
length
previousWord
nextWord
nextWordNumberOfSymbols
...
And then use a classification algorithm, and feed it positive and negative examples:
Observation  nLetters  nSymbols  length  prevWord  nextWord isPartOfDate  
""Feb.""       3         1         4       ""Wed""     ""29th""   TRUE  
""DEC""        3         0         3       ""company"" ""went""   FALSE  
...
You might get away with 50 examples of each, but the more the merrier. Then, the algorithm learns based on those examples, and can apply to future examples that it hasn't seen before.
It might learn rules such as
if previous word is only characters and maybe periods...
and current word is in ""february"", ""mar."", ""the"" ...
and next word is in ""twelfth"", any_number ...

I have noticed that when One Hot encoding is used on a particular data set (a matrix) and used as training data for learning algorithms, it gives significantly better results with respect to prediction accuracy, compared to using the original matrix itself as training data. How does this performance increase happen?","
Many learning algorithms either learn a single weight per feature, or they use distances between samples. The former is the case for linear models such as logistic regression, which are easy to explain.
Suppose you have a dataset having only a single categorical feature ""nationality"", with values ""UK"", ""French"" and ""US"". Assume, without loss of generality, that these are encoded as 0, 1 and 2. You then have a weight w for this feature in a linear classifier, which will make some kind of decision based on the constraint w×x + b > 0, or equivalently w×x < b.
The problem now is that the weight w cannot encode a three-way choice. The three possible values of w×x are 0, w and 2×w. Either these three all lead to the same decision (they're all < b or ≥b) or ""UK"" and ""French"" lead to the same decision, or ""French"" and ""US"" give the same decision. There's no possibility for the model to learn that ""UK"" and ""US"" should be given the same label, with ""French"" the odd one out.
By one-hot encoding, you effectively blow up the feature space to three features, which will each get their own weights, so the decision function is now w[UK]x[UK] + w[FR]x[FR] + w[US]x[US] < b, where all the x's are booleans. In this space, such a linear function can express any sum/disjunction of the possibilities (e.g. ""UK or US"", which might be a predictor for someone speaking English).
Similarly, any learner based on standard distance metrics (such as k-nearest neighbors) between samples will get confused without one-hot encoding. With the naive encoding and Euclidean distance, the distance between French and US is 1. The distance between US and UK is 2. But with the one-hot encoding, the pairwise distances between [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] and [0, 0, 1] are all equal to √2.
This is not true for all learning algorithms; decision trees and derived models such as random forests, if deep enough, can handle categorical variables without one-hot encoding."

update: this question is related to Google Colab's ""Notebook settings: Hardware accelerator: GPU"". This question was written before the ""TPU"" option was added.
Reading multiple excited announcements about Google Colaboratory providing free Tesla K80 GPU, I tried to run fast.ai lesson on it for it to never complete - quickly running out of memory. I started investigating of why.
The bottom line is that “free Tesla K80” is not ""free"" for all - for some only a small slice of it is ""free"".
I connect to Google Colab from West Coast Canada and I get only 0.5GB of what supposed to be a 24GB GPU RAM. Other users get access to 11GB of GPU RAM.
Clearly 0.5GB GPU RAM is insufficient for most ML/DL work.
If you're not sure what you get, here is little debug function I scraped together (only works with the GPU setting of the notebook):
# memory footprint support libraries/code
!ln -sf /opt/bin/nvidia-smi /usr/bin/nvidia-smi
!pip install gputil
!pip install psutil
!pip install humanize
import psutil
import humanize
import os
import GPUtil as GPU
GPUs = GPU.getGPUs()
# XXX: only one GPU on Colab and isn’t guaranteed
gpu = GPUs[0]
def printm():
 process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
 print(""Gen RAM Free: "" + humanize.naturalsize( psutil.virtual_memory().available ), "" | Proc size: "" + humanize.naturalsize( process.memory_info().rss))

printm()
Executing it in a jupyter notebook before running any other code gives me:
Gen RAM Free: 11.6 GB  | Proc size: 666.0 MB
GPU RAM Free: 566MB | Used: 10873MB | Util  95% | Total 11439MB
The lucky users who get access to the full card will see:
Gen RAM Free: 11.6 GB  | Proc size: 666.0 MB
GPU RAM Free: 11439MB | Used: 0MB | Util  0% | Total 11439MB
Do you see any flaw in my calculation of the GPU RAM availability, borrowed from GPUtil?
Can you confirm that you get similar results if you run this code on Google Colab notebook?
If my calculations are correct, is there any way to get more of that GPU RAM on the free box?
update: I'm not sure why some of us get 1/20th of what other users get. e.g. the person who helped me to debug this is from India and he gets the whole thing!
note: please don't send any more suggestions on how to kill the potentially stuck/runaway/parallel notebooks that might be consuming parts of the GPU.

So to prevent another dozen of answers suggesting invalid in the context of this thread suggestion to !kill -9 -1, let's close this thread:
The answer is simple:
As of this writing Google simply gives only 5% of GPU to some of us, whereas 100% to the others. Period.
dec-2019 update: The problem still exists - this question's upvotes continue still.
mar-2019 update: A year later a Google employee @AmiF commented on the state of things, stating that the problem doesn't exist, and anybody who seems to have this problem needs to simply reset their runtime to recover memory. Yet, the upvotes continue, which to me this tells that the problem still exists, despite @AmiF's suggestion to the contrary.
dec-2018 update: I have a theory that Google may have a blacklist of certain accounts, or perhaps browser fingerprints, when its robots detect a non-standard behavior. It could be a total coincidence, but for quite some time I had an issue with Google Re-captcha on any website that happened to require it, where I'd have to go through dozens of puzzles before I'd be allowed through, often taking me 10+ min to accomplish. This lasted for many months. All of a sudden as of this month I get no puzzles at all and any google re-captcha gets resolved with just a single mouse click, as it used to be almost a year ago.
And why I'm telling this story? Well, because at the same time I was given 100% of the GPU RAM on Colab. That's why my suspicion is that if you are on a theoretical Google black list then you aren't being trusted to be given a lot of resources for free. I wonder if any of you find the same correlation between the limited GPU access and the Re-captcha nightmare. As I said, it could be totally a coincidence as well."

I am trying to build a neural network from scratch. Across all AI literature there is a consensus that weights should be initialized to random numbers in order for the network to converge faster.
But why are neural networks initial weights initialized as random numbers?
I had read somewhere that this is done to ""break the symmetry"" and this makes the neural network learn faster. How does breaking the symmetry make it learn faster?
Wouldn't initializing the weights to 0 be a better idea? That way the weights would be able to find their values (whether positive or negative) faster?
Is there some other underlying philosophy behind randomizing the weights apart from hoping that they would be near their optimum values when initialized?",

I'm following a tutorial about machine learning basics and there is mentioned that something can be a feature or a label.
From what I know, a feature is a property of data that is being used. I can't figure out what the label is, I know the meaning of the word, but I want to know what it means in the context of machine learning.","
Briefly, feature is input; label is output. This applies to both classification and regression problems.
A feature is one column of the data in your input set. For instance, if you're trying to predict the type of pet someone will choose, your input features might include age, home region, family income, etc. The label is the final choice, such as dog, fish, iguana, rock, etc.
Once you've trained your model, you will give it sets of new input containing those features; it will return the predicted ""label"" (pet type) for that person."

Improve this question
Expectation Maximization (EM) is a kind of probabilistic method to classify data. Please correct me if I am wrong if it is not a classifier.
What is an intuitive explanation of this EM technique? What is expectation here and what is being maximized?","
Note: the code behind this answer can be found here.
Suppose we have some data sampled from two different groups, red and blue:
Here, we can see which data point belongs to the red or blue group. This makes it easy to find the parameters that characterise each group. For example, the mean of the red group is around 3, the mean of the blue group is around 7 (and we could find the exact means if we wanted).
This is, generally speaking, known as maximum likelihood estimation. Given some data, we compute the value of a parameter (or parameters) that best explains that data.
Now imagine that we cannot see which value was sampled from which group. Everything looks purple to us:
Here we have the knowledge that there are two groups of values, but we don't know which group any particular value belongs to.
Can we still estimate the means for the red group and blue group that best fit this data?
Yes, often we can! Expectation Maximisation gives us a way to do it. The very general idea behind the algorithm is this:
Start with an initial estimate of what each parameter might be.
Compute the likelihood that each parameter produces the data point.
Calculate weights for each data point indicating whether it is more red or more blue based on the likelihood of it being produced by a parameter. Combine the weights with the data (expectation).
Compute a better estimate for the parameters using the weight-adjusted data (maximisation).
Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the parameter estimate converges (the process stops producing a different estimate).
These steps need some further explanation, so I'll walk through the problem described above.
Example: estimating mean and standard deviation
I'll use Python in this example, but the code should be fairly easy to understand if you're not familiar with this language.
Suppose we have two groups, red and blue, with the values distributed as in the image above. Specifically, each group contains a value drawn from a normal distribution with the following parameters:
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

np.random.seed(110) # for reproducible results

# set parameters
red_mean = 3
red_std = 0.8

blue_mean = 7
blue_std = 2

# draw 20 samples from normal distributions with red/blue parameters
red = np.random.normal(red_mean, red_std, size=20)
blue = np.random.normal(blue_mean, blue_std, size=20)

both_colours = np.sort(np.concatenate((red, blue))) # for later use...
Here is an image of these red and blue groups again (to save you from having to scroll up):
When we can see the colour of each point (i.e. which group it belongs to), it's very easy to estimate the mean and standard deviation for each each group. We just pass the red and blue values to the builtin functions in NumPy. For example:
>>> np.mean(red)
2.802
>>> np.std(red)
0.871
>>> np.mean(blue)
6.932
>>> np.std(blue)
2.195
But what if we can't see the colours of the points? That is, instead of red or blue, every point has been coloured purple.
To try and recover the mean and standard deviation parameters for the red and blue groups, we can use Expectation Maximisation.
Our first step (step 1 above) is to guess at the parameter values for each group's mean and standard deviation. We don't have to guess intelligently; we can pick any numbers we like:
# estimates for the mean
red_mean_guess = 1.1
blue_mean_guess = 9

# estimates for the standard deviation
red_std_guess = 2
blue_std_guess = 1.7
These parameter estimates produce bell curves that look like this:
These are bad estimates. Both means (the vertical dotted lines) look far off any kind of ""middle"" for sensible groups of points, for instance. We want to improve these estimates.
The next step (step 2) is to compute the likelihood of each data point appearing under the current parameter guesses:
likelihood_of_red = stats.norm(red_mean_guess, red_std_guess).pdf(both_colours)
likelihood_of_blue = stats.norm(blue_mean_guess, blue_std_guess).pdf(both_colours)
Here, we have simply put each data point into the probability density function for a normal distribution using our current guesses at the mean and standard deviation for red and blue. This tells us, for example, that with our current guesses the data point at 1.761 is much more likely to be red (0.189) than blue (0.00003).
For each data point, we can turn these two likelihood values into weights (step 3) so that they sum to 1 as follows:
likelihood_total = likelihood_of_red + likelihood_of_blue

red_weight = likelihood_of_red / likelihood_total
blue_weight = likelihood_of_blue / likelihood_total
With our current estimates and our newly-computed weights, we can now compute new estimates for the mean and standard deviation of the red and blue groups (step 4).
We twice compute the mean and standard deviation using all data points, but with the different weightings: once for the red weights and once for the blue weights.
The key bit of intuition is that the greater the weight of a colour on a data point, the more the data point influences the next estimates for that colour's parameters. This has the effect of ""pulling"" the parameters in the right direction.
def estimate_mean(data, weight):
    """"""
    For each data point, multiply the point by the probability it
    was drawn from the colour's distribution (its ""weight"").

    Divide by the total weight: essentially, we're finding where

    """"""
    return np.sum(data * weight) / np.sum(weight)

def estimate_std(data, weight, mean):
    """"""

    root to find the standard deviation.
    """"""
    variance = np.sum(weight * (data - mean)**2) / np.sum(weight)
    return np.sqrt(variance)

# new estimates for standard deviation
blue_std_guess = estimate_std(both_colours, blue_weight, blue_mean_guess)
red_std_guess = estimate_std(both_colours, red_weight, red_mean_guess)

# new estimates for mean
red_mean_guess = estimate_mean(both_colours, red_weight)
blue_mean_guess = estimate_mean(both_colours, blue_weight)
We have new estimates for the parameters. To improve them again, we can jump back to step 2 and repeat the process. We do this until the estimates converge, or after some number of iterations have been performed (step 5).
For our data, the first five iterations of this process look like this (recent iterations have stronger appearance):
We see that the means are already converging on some values, and the shapes of the curves (governed by the standard deviation) are also becoming more stable.
If we continue for 20 iterations, we end up with the following:
The EM process has converged to the following values, which turn out to very close to the actual values (where we can see the colours - no hidden variables):
          | EM guess | Actual |  Delta
----------+----------+--------+-------
Red mean  |    2.910 |  2.802 |  0.108
Red std   |    0.854 |  0.871 | -0.017
Blue mean |    6.838 |  6.932 | -0.094
Blue std  |    2.227 |  2.195 |  0.032
In the code above you may have noticed that the new estimation for standard deviation was computed using the previous iteration's estimate for the mean. Ultimately it does not matter if we compute a new value for the mean first as we are just finding the (weighted) variance of values around some central point. We will still see the estimates for the parameters converge.

54,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33962226/common-causes-of-nans-during-training-of-neural-networks,Common causes of nans during training of neural networks,"
I've noticed that a frequent occurrence during training is NANs being introduced.
Often times it seems to be introduced by weights in inner-product/fully-connected or convolution layers blowing up.
Is this occurring because the gradient computation is blowing up? Or is it because of weight initialization (if so, why does weight initialization have this effect)? Or is it likely caused by the nature of the input data?
The overarching question here is simply: What is the most common reason for NANs to occurring during training? And secondly, what are some methods for combatting this (and why do they work)?","
I came across this phenomenon several times. Here are my observations:
Gradient blow up
Reason: large gradients throw the learning process off-track.
What you should expect: Looking at the runtime log, you should look at the loss values per-iteration. You'll notice that the loss starts to grow significantly from iteration to iteration, eventually the loss will be too large to be represented by a floating point variable and it will become nan.
What can you do: Decrease the base_lr (in the solver.prototxt) by an order of magnitude (at least). If you have several loss layers, you should inspect the log to see which layer is responsible for the gradient blow up and decrease the loss_weight (in train_val.prototxt) for that specific layer, instead of the general base_lr.
Bad learning rate policy and params
Reason: caffe fails to compute a valid learning rate and gets 'inf' or 'nan' instead, this invalid rate multiplies all updates and thus invalidating all parameters.
What you should expect: Looking at the runtime log, you should see that the learning rate itself becomes 'nan', for example:
... sgd_solver.cpp:106] Iteration 0, lr = -nan
What can you do: fix all parameters affecting the learning rate in your 'solver.prototxt' file.
For instance, if you use lr_policy: ""poly"" and you forget to define max_iter parameter, you'll end up with lr = nan...
For more information about learning rate in caffe, see this thread.
Faulty Loss function
Reason: Sometimes the computations of the loss in the loss layers causes nans to appear. For example, Feeding InfogainLoss layer with non-normalized values, using custom loss layer with bugs, etc.
What you should expect: Looking at the runtime log you probably won't notice anything unusual: loss is decreasing gradually, and all of a sudden a nan appears.
What can you do: See if you can reproduce the error, add printout to the loss layer and debug the error.
For example: Once I used a loss that normalized the penalty by the frequency of label occurrence in a batch. It just so happened that if one of the training labels did not appear in the batch at all - the loss computed produced nans. In that case, working with large enough batches (with respect to the number of labels in the set) was enough to avoid this error.
Faulty input
Reason: you have an input with nan in it!
What you should expect: once the learning process ""hits"" this faulty input - output becomes nan. Looking at the runtime log you probably won't notice anything unusual: loss is decreasing gradually, and all of a sudden a nan appears.
What can you do: re-build your input datasets (lmdb/leveldn/hdf5...) make sure you do not have bad image files in your training/validation set. For debug you can build a simple net that read the input layer, has a dummy loss on top of it and runs through all the inputs: if one of them is faulty, this dummy net should also produce nan.
stride larger than kernel size in ""Pooling"" layer
For some reason, choosing stride > kernel_size for pooling may results with nans. For example:
layer {
  name: ""faulty_pooling""
  type: ""Pooling""
  bottom: ""x""
  top: ""y""
  pooling_param {
    pool: AVE
    stride: 5
    kernel: 3
  }
}
results with nans in y.
Instabilities in ""BatchNorm""
It was reported that under some settings ""BatchNorm"" layer may output nans due to numerical instabilities.
This issue was raised in bvlc/caffe and PR #5136 is attempting to fix it.
Recently, I became aware of debug_info flag: setting debug_info: true in 'solver.prototxt' will make caffe print to log more debug information (including gradient magnitudes and activation values) during training: This information can help in spotting gradient blowups and other problems in the training process."

I have five text files that I input to a CountVectorizer. When specifying min_df and max_df to the CountVectorizer instance what does the min/max document frequency exactly mean? Is it the frequency of a word in its particular text file or is it the frequency of the word in the entire overall corpus (five text files)?
What are the differences when min_df and max_df are provided as integers or as floats?
The documentation doesn't seem to provide a thorough explanation nor does it supply an example to demonstrate the use of these two parameters. Could someone provide an explanation or example demonstrating min_df and max_df?","
max_df is used for removing terms that appear too frequently, also known as ""corpus-specific stop words"". For example:
max_df = 0.50 means ""ignore terms that appear in more than 50% of the documents"".
max_df = 25 means ""ignore terms that appear in more than 25 documents"".
The default max_df is 1.0, which means ""ignore terms that appear in more than 100% of the documents"". Thus, the default setting does not ignore any terms.
min_df is used for removing terms that appear too infrequently. For example:
min_df = 0.01 means ""ignore terms that appear in less than 1% of the documents"".
min_df = 5 means ""ignore terms that appear in less than 5 documents"".
The default min_df is 1, which means ""ignore terms that appear in less than 1 document"". Thus, the default setting does not ignore any terms."

You're getting the error because result defined as Sequential() is just a container for the model and you have not defined an input for it.

However, my preferred way of building a model that has this type of input structure would be to use the functional api.
Here is an implementation of your requirements to get you started:
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Concatenate, Dense, LSTM, Input, concatenate
from keras.optimizers import Adagrad

first_input = Input(shape=(2, ))
first_dense = Dense(1, )(first_input)

second_input = Input(shape=(2, ))
second_dense = Dense(1, )(second_input)

merge_one = concatenate([first_dense, second_dense])

third_input = Input(shape=(1, ))
merge_two = concatenate([merge_one, third_input])

model = Model(inputs=[first_input, second_input, third_input], outputs=merge_two)
ada_grad = Adagrad(lr=0.1, epsilon=1e-08, decay=0.0)
model.compile(optimizer=ada_grad, loss='binary_crossentropy',
               metrics=['accuracy'])
To answer the question in the comments:
How are result and merged connected? Assuming you mean how are they concatenated.
Concatenation works like this:
  a        b         c
a b c   g h i    a b c g h i
d e f   j k l    d e f j k l
i.e rows are just joined.
Now, x1 is input to first, x2 is input into second and x3 input into third.
first = Sequential()
first.add(Dense(1, input_shape=(2,), activation='sigmoid'))

second = Sequential()
second.add(Dense(1, input_shape=(1,), activation='sigmoid'))

Gradient clipping needs to happen after computing the gradients, but before applying them to update the model's parameters. In your example, both of those things are handled by the AdamOptimizer.minimize() method.
In order to clip your gradients you'll need to explicitly compute, clip, and apply them as described in this section in TensorFlow's API documentation. Specifically you'll need to substitute the call to the minimize() method with something like the following:
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=learning_rate)
gvs = optimizer.compute_gradients(cost)
capped_gvs = [(tf.clip_by_value(grad, -1., 1.), var) for grad, var in gvs]

I'm reading the paper below and I have some trouble , understanding the concept of negative sampling.
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3722v1.pdf
Can anyone help , please?","
The idea of word2vec is to maximise the similarity (dot product) between the vectors for words which appear close together (in the context of each other) in text, and minimise the similarity of words that do not. In equation (3) of the paper you link to, ignore the exponentiation for a moment. You have
      v_c . v_w
 -------------------
   sum_i(v_ci . v_w)
The numerator is basically the similarity between words c (the context) and w (the target) word. The denominator computes the similarity of all other contexts ci and the target word w. Maximising this ratio ensures words that appear closer together in text have more similar vectors than words that do not. However, computing this can be very slow, because there are many contexts ci. Negative sampling is one of the ways of addressing this problem- just select a couple of contexts ci at random. The end result is that if cat appears in the context of food, then the vector of food is more similar to the vector of cat (as measures by their dot product) than the vectors of several other randomly chosen words (e.g. democracy, greed, Freddy), instead of all other words in language. This makes word2vec much much faster to train."

There are ways to tell json how to encode numpy objects, which you can learn about from this other question, so there's nothing wrong with using json in this case, it's just more complicated than simply dumping to a pickle file.

If we have 10 eigenvectors then we can have 10 neural nodes in input layer.If we have 5 output classes then we can have 5 nodes in output layer.But what is the criteria for choosing number of hidden layer in a MLP and how many neural nodes in 1 hidden layer?","
how many hidden layers?
a model with zero hidden layers will resolve linearly separable data. So unless you already know your data isn't linearly separable, it doesn't hurt to verify this--why use a more complex model than the task requires? If it is linearly separable then a simpler technique will work, but a Perceptron will do the job as well.
Assuming your data does require separation by a non-linear technique, then always start with one hidden layer. Almost certainly that's all you will need. If your data is separable using a MLP, then that MLP probably only needs a single hidden layer. There is theoretical justification for this, but my reason is purely empirical: Many difficult classification/regression problems are solved using single-hidden-layer MLPs, yet I don't recall encountering any multiple-hidden-layer MLPs used to successfully model data--whether on ML bulletin boards, ML Textbooks, academic papers, etc. They exist, certainly, but the circumstances that justify their use is empirically quite rare.

How many nodes in the hidden layer?
From the MLP academic literature. my own experience, etc., I have gathered and often rely upon several rules of thumb (RoT), and which I have also found to be reliable guides (ie., the guidance was accurate, and even when it wasn't, it was usually clear what to do next):
RoT based on improving convergence:
When you begin the model building, err on the side of more nodes in the hidden layer.
Why? First, a few extra nodes in the hidden layer isn't likely do any any harm--your MLP will still converge. On the other hand, too few nodes in the hidden layer can prevent convergence. Think of it this way, additional nodes provides some excess capacity--additional weights to store/release signal to the network during iteration (training, or model building). Second, if you begin with additional nodes in your hidden layer, then it's easy to prune them later (during iteration progress). This is common and there are diagnostic techniques to assist you (e.g., Hinton Diagram, which is just a visual depiction of the weight matrices, a 'heat map' of the weight values,).
RoTs based on size of input layer and size of output layer:
A rule of thumb is for the size of this [hidden] layer to be somewhere between the input layer size ... and the output layer size....
To calculate the number of hidden nodes we use a general rule of: (Number of inputs + outputs) x 2/3
RoT based on principal components:
Typically, we specify as many hidden nodes as dimensions [principal components] needed to capture 70-90% of the variance of the input data set.
And yet the NN FAQ author calls these Rules ""nonsense"" (literally) because they: ignore the number of training instances, the noise in the targets (values of the response variables), and the complexity of the feature space.
In his view (and it always seemed to me that he knows what he's talking about), choose the number of neurons in the hidden layer based on whether your MLP includes some form of regularization, or early stopping.

The only valid technique for optimizing the number of neurons in the Hidden Layer:
During your model building, test obsessively; testing will reveal the signatures of ""incorrect"" network architecture. For instance, if you begin with an MLP having a hidden layer comprised of a small number of nodes (which you will gradually increase as needed, based on test results) your training and generalization error will both be high caused by bias and underfitting.
Then increase the number of nodes in the hidden layer, one at a time, until the generalization error begins to increase, this time due to overfitting and high variance.
In practice, I do it this way:
input layer: the size of my data vactor (the number of features in my model) + 1 for the bias node and not including the response variable, of course
output layer: soley determined by my model: regression (one node) versus classification (number of nodes equivalent to the number of classes, assuming softmax)
hidden layer: to start, one hidden layer with a number of nodes equal to the size of the input layer. The ""ideal"" size is more likely to be smaller (i.e, some number of nodes between the number in the input layer and the number in the output layer) rather than larger--again, this is just an empirical observation, and the bulk of this observation is my own experience. If the project justified the additional time required, then I start with a single hidden layer comprised of a small number of nodes, then (as i explained just above) I add nodes to the Hidden Layer, one at a time, while calculating the generalization error, training error, bias, and variance. When generalization error has dipped and just before it begins to increase again, the number of nodes at that point is my choice. See figure below."

In keras - while building a sequential model - usually the second dimension (one after sample dimension) - is related to a time dimension. This means that if for example, your data is 5-dim with (sample, time, width, length, channel) you could apply a convolutional layer using TimeDistributed (which is applicable to 4-dim with (sample, width, length, channel)) along a time dimension (applying the same layer to each time slice) in order to obtain 5-d output.
The case with Dense is that in keras from version 2.0 Dense is by default applied to only last dimension (e.g. if you apply Dense(10) to input with shape (n, m, o, p) you'll get output with shape (n, m, o, 10)) so in your case Dense and TimeDistributed(Dense) are equivalent."

I know that there are a lot of explanations of what cross-entropy is, but I'm still confused.
Is it only a method to describe the loss function? Can we use gradient descent algorithm to find the minimum using the loss function?","
Cross-entropy is commonly used to quantify the difference between two probability distributions. In the context of machine learning, it is a measure of error for categorical multi-class classification problems. Usually the ""true"" distribution (the one that your machine learning algorithm is trying to match) is expressed in terms of a one-hot distribution.
For example, suppose for a specific training instance, the true label is B (out of the possible labels A, B, and C). The one-hot distribution for this training instance is therefore:
Pr(Class A)  Pr(Class B)  Pr(Class C)
        0.0          1.0          0.0
You can interpret the above true distribution to mean that the training instance has 0% probability of being class A, 100% probability of being class B, and 0% probability of being class C.
Now, suppose your machine learning algorithm predicts the following probability distribution:
Pr(Class A)  Pr(Class B)  Pr(Class C)
      0.228        0.619        0.153
How close is the predicted distribution to the true distribution? That is what the cross-entropy loss determines. Use this formula:
Where p(x) is the true probability distribution (one-hot) and q(x) is the predicted probability distribution. The sum is over the three classes A, B, and C. In this case the loss is 0.479 :
H = - (0.0*ln(0.228) + 1.0*ln(0.619) + 0.0*ln(0.153)) = 0.479

Note that it does not matter what logarithm base you use as long as you consistently use the same one. As it happens, the Python Numpy log() function computes the natural log (log base e).
Python code
Here is the above example expressed in Python using Numpy:
import numpy as np

p = np.array([0, 1, 0])             # True probability (one-hot)
q = np.array([0.228, 0.619, 0.153]) # Predicted probability

cross_entropy_loss = -np.sum(p * np.log(q))
print(cross_entropy_loss)
# 0.47965000629754095
So that is how ""wrong"" or ""far away"" your prediction is from the true distribution. A machine learning optimizer will attempt to minimize the loss (i.e. it will try to reduce the loss from 0.479 to 0.0).
Loss units
We see in the above example that the loss is 0.4797. Because we are using the natural log (log base e), the units are in nats, so we say that the loss is 0.4797 nats. If the log were instead log base 2, then the units are in bits. See this page for further explanation.
More examples
To gain more intuition on what these loss values reflect, let's look at some extreme examples.
Again, let's suppose the true (one-hot) distribution is:
Pr(Class A)  Pr(Class B)  Pr(Class C)
        0.0          1.0          0.0
Now suppose your machine learning algorithm did a really great job and predicted class B with very high probability:
Pr(Class A)  Pr(Class B)  Pr(Class C)
      0.001        0.998        0.001
When we compute the cross entropy loss, we can see that the loss is tiny, only 0.002:
p = np.array([0, 1, 0])
q = np.array([0.001, 0.998, 0.001])
print(-np.sum(p * np.log(q)))
# 0.0020020026706730793
At the other extreme, suppose your ML algorithm did a terrible job and predicted class C with high probability instead. The resulting loss of 6.91 will reflect the larger error.
Pr(Class A)  Pr(Class B)  Pr(Class C)
      0.001        0.001        0.998
p = np.array([0, 1, 0])
q = np.array([0.001, 0.001, 0.998])
print(-np.sum(p * np.log(q)))
# 6.907755278982137
Now, what happens in the middle of these two extremes? Suppose your ML algorithm can't make up its mind and predicts the three classes with nearly equal probability.
Pr(Class A)  Pr(Class B)  Pr(Class C)
      0.333        0.333        0.334
The resulting loss is 1.10.
p = np.array([0, 1, 0])
q = np.array([0.333, 0.333, 0.334])
print(-np.sum(p * np.log(q)))
# 1.0996127890016931
Fitting into gradient descent
Cross entropy is one out of many possible loss functions (another popular one is SVM hinge loss). These loss functions are typically written as J(theta) and can be used within gradient descent, which is an iterative algorithm to move the parameters (or coefficients) towards the optimum values. In the equation below, you would replace J(theta) with H(p, q). But note that you need to compute the derivative of H(p, q) with respect to the parameters first.
So to answer your original questions directly:
Is it only a method to describe the loss function?
Correct, cross-entropy describes the loss between two probability distributions. It is one of many possible loss functions.
Then we can use, for example, gradient descent algorithm to find the minimum.
Yes, the cross-entropy loss function can be used as part of gradient descent.

My problem:
I have a dataset which is a large JSON file. I read it and store it in the trainList variable.
Next, I pre-process it - in order to be able to work with it.
Once I have done that I start the classification:
I use the kfold cross validation method in order to obtain the mean accuracy and train a classifier.
I make the predictions and obtain the accuracy & confusion matrix of that fold.
After this, I would like to obtain the True Positive(TP), True Negative(TN), False Positive(FP) and False Negative(FN) values. I'll use these parameters to obtain the Sensitivity and Specificity.
Finally, I would use this to put in HTML in order to show a chart with the TPs of each label.
Code:
The variables I have for the moment:
trainList #It is a list with all the data of my dataset in JSON form
labelList #It is a list with all the labels of my data 
Most part of the method:
#I transform the data from JSON form to a numerical one
X=vec.fit_transform(trainList)

#I scale the matrix (don't know why but without it, it makes an error)
X=preprocessing.scale(X.toarray())

#I generate a KFold in order to make cross validation
kf = KFold(len(X), n_folds=10, indices=True, shuffle=True, random_state=1)

#I start the cross validation
for train_indices, test_indices in kf:
    X_train=[X[ii] for ii in train_indices]
    X_test=[X[ii] for ii in test_indices]
    y_train=[listaLabels[ii] for ii in train_indices]
    y_test=[listaLabels[ii] for ii in test_indices]

    #I train the classifier
    trained=qda.fit(X_train,y_train)

    #I make the predictions
    predicted=qda.predict(X_test)

    #I obtain the accuracy of this fold
    ac=accuracy_score(predicted,y_test)

    #I obtain the confusion matrix
    cm=confusion_matrix(y_test, predicted)

    #I should calculate the TP,TN, FP and FN 
    #I don't know how to continue

If you have two lists that have the predicted and actual values; as it appears you do, you can pass them to a function that will calculate TP, FP, TN, FN with something like this:
def perf_measure(y_actual, y_hat):
    TP = 0
    FP = 0
    TN = 0
    FN = 0

    for i in range(len(y_hat)): 
        if y_actual[i]==y_hat[i]==1:
           TP += 1
        if y_hat[i]==1 and y_actual[i]!=y_hat[i]:
           FP += 1
        if y_actual[i]==y_hat[i]==0:
           TN += 1
        if y_hat[i]==0 and y_actual[i]!=y_hat[i]:
           FN += 1

    return(TP, FP, TN, FN)
From here I think you will be able to calculate rates of interest to you, and other performance measure like specificity and sensitivity.
def perf_measure(y_actual, y_hat):
    TP = 0
    FP = 0
    TN = 0
    FN = 0

           TN += 1

In Computer Vision and Object Detection, a common evaluation method is mAP. What is it and how is it calculated?","
Quotes are from the above mentioned Zisserman paper - 4.2 Evaluation of Results (Page 11):
First an ""overlap criterion"" is defined as an intersection-over-union greater than 0.5. (e.g. if a predicted box satisfies this criterion with respect to a ground-truth box, it is considered a detection). Then a matching is made between the GT boxes and the predicted boxes using this ""greedy"" approach:
Detections output by a method were assigned to ground truth objects satisfying the overlap criterion in order ranked by the (decreasing) confidence output. Multiple detections of the same object in an image were considered false detections e.g. 5 detections of a single object counted as 1 correct detection and 4 false detections
Hence each predicted box is either True-Positive or False-Positive. Each ground-truth box is True-Positive. There are no True-Negatives.
Then the average precision is computed by averaging the precision values on the precision-recall curve where the recall is in the range [0, 0.1, ..., 1] (e.g. average of 11 precision values). To be more precise, we consider a slightly corrected PR curve, where for each curve point (p, r), if there is a different curve point (p', r') such that p' > p and r' >= r, we replace p with maximum p' of those points.
What is still unclear to me is what is done with those GT boxes that are never detected (even if the confidence is 0). This means that there are certain recall values that the precision-recall curve will never reach, and this makes the average precision computation above undefined.
Edit:
Short answer: in the region where the recall is unreachable, the precision drops to 0.
One way to explain this is to assume that when the threshold for the confidence approaches 0, an infinite number of predicted bounding boxes light up all over the image. The precision then immediately goes to 0 (since there is only a finite number of GT boxes) and the recall keeps growing on this flat curve until we reach 100%."

I'm working on a classification problem with unbalanced classes (5% 1's). I want to predict the class, not the probability.
In a binary classification problem, is scikit's classifier.predict() using 0.5 by default? If it doesn't, what's the default method? If it does, how do I change it?
In scikit some classifiers have the class_weight='auto' option, but not all do. With class_weight='auto', would .predict() use the actual population proportion as a threshold?
What would be the way to do this in a classifier like MultinomialNB that doesn't support class_weight? Other than using predict_proba() and then calculation the classes myself.","
is scikit's classifier.predict() using 0.5 by default?
In probabilistic classifiers, yes. It's the only sensible threshold from a mathematical viewpoint, as others have explained.
What would be the way to do this in a classifier like MultinomialNB that doesn't support class_weight?
You can set the class_prior, which is the prior probability P(y) per class y. That effectively shifts the decision boundary. E.g.
# minimal dataset
>>> X = [[1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]
>>> y = [0, 0, 1]
# use empirical prior, learned from y
>>> MultinomialNB().fit(X,y).predict([1,1])
array([0])
# use custom prior to make 1 more likely
>>> MultinomialNB(class_prior=[.1, .9]).fit(X,y).predict([1,1])
array([1])
# minimal dataset
>>> X = [[1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]
>>> y = [0, 0, 1]
# use empirical prior, learned from y
>>> MultinomialNB().fit(X,y).predict([1,1])
array([0])
# use custom prior to make 1 more likely
>>> MultinomialNB(class_prior=[.1, .9]).fit(X,y).predict([1,1])
array([1])"

WIth the Help of @excray's comment, I manage to figure it out the answer, What we need to do is actually write a simple for loop to iterate over the two arrays that represent the train data and test data.
First implement a simple lambda function to hold formula for the cosine calculation:
cosine_function = lambda a, b : round(np.inner(a, b)/(LA.norm(a)*LA.norm(b)), 3)
And then just write a simple for loop to iterate over the to vector, logic is for every ""For each vector in trainVectorizerArray, you have to find the cosine similarity with the vector in testVectorizerArray.""

The warning means what it mainly says: Suggestions to try to make the solver (the algorithm) converges.
lbfgs stand for: ""Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno Algorithm"". It is one of the solvers' algorithms provided by Scikit-Learn Library.
The term limited-memory simply means it stores only a few vectors that represent the gradients approximation implicitly.
It has better convergence on relatively small datasets.
But what is algorithm convergence?
In simple words. If the error of solving is ranging within very small range (i.e., it is almost not changing), then that means the algorithm reached the solution (not necessary to be the best solution as it might be stuck at what so-called ""local Optima"").
On the other hand, if the error is varying noticeably (even if the error is relatively small [like in your case the score was good], but rather the differences between the errors per iteration is greater than some tolerance) then we say the algorithm did not converge.
Now, you need to know that Scikit-Learn API sometimes provides the user the option to specify the maximum number of iterations the algorithm should take while it's searching for the solution in an iterative manner:
LogisticRegression(... solver='lbfgs', max_iter=100 ...)
As you can see, the default solver in LogisticRegression is 'lbfgs' and the maximum number of iterations is 100 by default.
Final words, please, however, note that increasing the maximum number of iterations does not necessarily guarantee convergence, but it certainly helps!
Update:
Based on your comment below, some tips to try (out of many) that might help the algorithm to converge are:
Increase the number of iterations: As in this answer;
Try a different optimizer: Look here;
Scale your data: Look here;
Add engineered features: Look here;
Data pre-processing: Look here - use case and here;
Add more data: Look here.

For example, below I've created a 2-D tensor, and I need to get the number of rows and columns as int32 so that I can call reshape() to create a tensor of shape (num_rows * num_cols, 1). However, the method tensor.get_shape() returns values as Dimension type, not int32.

To get the shape as a list of ints, do tensor.get_shape().as_list().
To complete your tf.shape() call, try tensor2 = tf.reshape(tensor, tf.TensorShape([num_rows*num_cols, 1])). Or you can directly do tensor2 = tf.reshape(tensor, tf.TensorShape([-1, 1])) where its first dimension can be inferred."

In the MNIST beginner tutorial, there is the statement
accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, ""float""))
tf.cast basically changes the type of tensor the object is, but what is the difference between tf.reduce_mean and np.mean?
Here is the doc on tf.reduce_mean:
reduce_mean(input_tensor, reduction_indices=None, keep_dims=False, name=None)
input_tensor: The tensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.
reduction_indices: The dimensions to reduce. If None (the defaut), reduces all dimensions.
# 'x' is [[1., 1. ]]
#         [2., 2.]]
tf.reduce_mean(x) ==> 1.5
tf.reduce_mean(x, 0) ==> [1.5, 1.5]
tf.reduce_mean(x, 1) ==> [1.,  2.]
For a 1D vector, it looks like np.mean == tf.reduce_mean, but I don't understand what's happening in tf.reduce_mean(x, 1) ==> [1.,  2.]. tf.reduce_mean(x, 0) ==> [1.5, 1.5] kind of makes sense, since mean of [1, 2] and [1, 2] is [1.5, 1.5], but what's going on with tf.reduce_mean(x, 1)?
accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, ""float""))
# 'x' is [[1., 1. ]]
#         [2., 2.]]
tf.reduce_mean(x) ==> 1.5
tf.reduce_mean(x, 0) ==> [1.5, 1.5]
tf.reduce_mean(x, 1) ==> [1.,  2.]","
The functionality of numpy.mean and tensorflow.reduce_mean are the same. They do the same thing. From the documentation, for numpy and tensorflow, you can see that. Lets look at an example,
c = np.array([[3.,4], [5.,6], [6.,7]])
print(np.mean(c,1))

Mean = tf.reduce_mean(c,1)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(Mean)
    print(result)
Output
[ 3.5  5.5  6.5]
[ 3.5  5.5  6.5]
Here you can see that when axis(numpy) or reduction_indices(tensorflow) is 1, it computes mean across (3,4) and (5,6) and (6,7), so 1 defines across which axis the mean is computed. When it is 0, the mean is computed across(3,5,6) and (4,6,7), and so on. I hope you get the idea.
Now what are the differences between them?
You can compute the numpy operation anywhere on python. But in order to do a tensorflow operation, it must be done inside a tensorflow Session. You can read more about it here. So when you need to perform any computation for your tensorflow graph(or structure if you will), it must be done inside a tensorflow Session.
Lets look at another example.
npMean = np.mean(c)
print(npMean+1)

tfMean = tf.reduce_mean(c)
Add = tfMean + 1
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(Add)
    print(result)
We could increase mean by 1 in numpy as you would naturally, but in order to do it in tensorflow, you need to perform that in Session, without using Session you can't do that. In other words, when you are computing tfMean = tf.reduce_mean(c), tensorflow doesn't compute it then. It only computes that in a Session. But numpy computes that instantly, when you write np.mean().
I hope it makes sense.
c = np.array([[3.,4], [5.,6], [6.,7]])
print(np.mean(c,1))

Mean = tf.reduce_mean(c,1)
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(Mean)
    print(result)
[ 3.5  5.5  6.5]
[ 3.5  5.5  6.5]
npMean = np.mean(c)
print(npMean+1)

tfMean = tf.reduce_mean(c)
Add = tfMean + 1
with tf.Session() as sess:
    result = sess.run(Add)
    print(result)"

OpenAI's REINFORCE and actor-critic example for reinforcement learning has the following code:
REINFORCE:
policy_loss = torch.cat(policy_loss).sum()
actor-critic:
loss = torch.stack(policy_losses).sum() + torch.stack(value_losses).sum()
One is using torch.cat, the other uses torch.stack, for similar use cases.
As far as my understanding goes, the doc doesn't give any clear distinction between them.
I would be happy to know the differences between the functions.
policy_loss = torch.cat(policy_loss).sum()
loss = torch.stack(policy_losses).sum() + torch.stack(value_losses).sum()","
stack
Concatenates sequence of tensors along a new dimension.
cat
Concatenates the given sequence of seq tensors in the given dimension.
So if A and B are of shape (3, 4):

torch.stack([A, B], dim=0) will be of shape (2, 3, 4)"
